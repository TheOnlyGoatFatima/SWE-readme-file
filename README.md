## About The Project:
The KFUPM Reservation center is a software solution designed to streamline the reservation process for classrooms, labs, and facilities within the KFUPM campus. The system aims to facilitate the reservation of university facilities in advance to avoid crowding, reservation conflicts, and providing administrators with complete reservation details for better management. Users may easily request rooms and facilities according to the automated reservation system, while administrators can effectively manage reservations with the tools provided.
